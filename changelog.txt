Great performance improvement.
Fixed bug, that caused a page to be missed on scanning for every false positive.
Fixed bug that caused error code not to be written in the log.
Removed /ScanAllBytes parameter as it is default, and makes no sense not to.

Commandline syntax changes. 
Changed the output file names to be prefixed with Carver_Indx_

Added validation checks on data inside INDX.
Set default INDX size to 4096 bytes.
Split out in 3.
